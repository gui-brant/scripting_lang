# scripting_lang
I'm going to post tutorials, some notes, and exercises that I have been doing for my scripting language fundamentals course. 
This course is essentially a JavaScript course. It also teaches fundamentals and applications on HTML and CSS. Exercises for these two languages were done through the codecademy tutorials. I learned the basics there, on top of reviewing the class material and listening to lectures. These tutorials can be found in the following links: https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-html AND https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-css 
Moreover, I have been doing a lot of JavaScript exercises through boo.dev's JavaScript course. That course can be found here: https://www.boot.dev/lessons/57964330-d749-41c5-8012-c0628c86a1c8
Since I was already studying through boot.dev, I have started on the JavaScript exercises earlier than the class, though I simultaneouly learned HTML and CSS. They all seem to work together, so I thought that condensing them was a good idea. If you'd like to check out my progress and notes speficially from the boot.dev exercises, please check out my bootdev_lessons repository. There, you will find a JavaScript folder with all of my notes from boot.dev.
